# Deployment — ST Edge AI benchmark plan and artifacts

Updated 2026-07-14.

## Why this board

**STM32H7B3I-DK**, for two reasons (user decision, recorded 2026-07-24):
(a) the published baseline deployed on STM32H7B3/F401, so measuring on the
same board makes the on-device comparison like-for-like; (b) the unit is
physically available in the ELIOS lab.

## ✔ SETTLED EMPIRICALLY: int16x8 is NOT deployable on ST Edge AI 4.0.1

**Measured 2026-07-14 on ST Edge AI Developer Cloud, Core 4.0.1-20581 — the
latest version.** `cls_best_int16x8.tflite` (a 117.9 KB file) was uploaded and
optimized for STM32 MCU. The result is identical to the float32 model to within
4 bytes:

| | cls_best_**int16x8** | cls_best_float32 | cls_best_**int8** (control) |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| **weights** | **326.15 KiB** | **326.15 KiB** | **83.28 KiB** |
| flash total | 343,258 B | 343,254 B | 106,738 B |
| RAM | 9,456 B | 9,456 B | 8,096 B |
| MACC | 158,094 | 158,094 | 158,336 |
| latency | 3.605 ms | 3.628 ms | 1.885 ms |

The prediction was: **~118 KB = real int16x8 support; ~338 KB = silently
dequantized**. The measurement landed on 335 KiB. A 117.9 KB int8-weight file
came back as a **326.15 KiB weight blob — byte-identical to float32** — while the
genuinely-int8 control compressed to 83.28 KiB as expected. ST expanded the int8
weights back to float32 and discarded the int16 activation scheme, exactly as
`quantization.html` warns ("if an operator is not supported in integer, floating
point version is used").

⚠ **Do not cite the `STAI_FORMAT_FLOAT` badge as evidence.** An earlier draft did.
It is wrong: the int8 model shows `STAI_FORMAT_FLOAT` *too*, yet is genuinely
quantized. The badge describes the **I/O interface** (all three of our files have
float32 input/output with quantize/dequantize wrappers — verified in the
flatbuffer), not the internal arithmetic. **The weights figure is the only sound
discriminator**, which is precisely why the test was specified on flash.

The uploaded file was verified genuine int16x8 first, so the converter is not
the confound: its graph carries int8 weights, int64 biases, and int16 activation
tensors (`input_layer:0_int16`, `StatefulPartitionedCall_1:0_int16`) with
float32 boundary wrappers.

**Consequence: int16x8 is an offline accuracy bound only. Never quote it as a
deployed configuration.** Benchmarking it naively would have yielded a
"91.9% at 3.6 ms in int16x8" line that is a float32 model wearing a costume —
the exact fabrication this check existed to prevent.

This also closes the "is the Sept-2025 evidence stale?" question: it was a fair
challenge (4.0.1 ships no release note, so docs alone could not disprove it),
but the empirical answer agrees with the docs.

### Prior documentary evidence (now corroborated by measurement)

Re-checked against the **currently served** docs on 2026-07-14 (not just the old
forum post):

- The hosted docs under `stedgeai-dc.st.com/assets/embedded-docs/` return
  `Last-Modified: Thu, 04 Jun 2026` — i.e. refreshed ~5 weeks ago, and still
  self-identify as *"ST Edge AI Core Technology 4.0.0"* (`quantization.html`
  rev r1.5).
- `quantization.html`: *"ST Edge AI Core supports 8-bit integer-based (int8 or
  uint8 data type) arithmetic for quantized tensors"*; TFLite table: activation
  type `int8` (ss/sa), weight type `int8` (ss/sa); float16 "not supported".
- `supported_ops_tflite.html`, Common constraints: *"data type for the
  weights/activations tensors must be: float32, int8, uint8"* (bias int32 only).
  The 12 `int16` hits are **only** on `SELECT`/`SELECT_V2` (element-wise
  pass-through) — a red herring, not quantized CONV/FC kernels.
- Full-text sweep of the **entire release-note history (v1.0.0 → v4.0.0)**:
  `16x8` = **0 hits**, `int16` = **0 hits**. The only 16-bit entries are QKeras
  fixed-point for the **ISPU** (sensor) target — unrelated to TFLite 16x8.
- ST moderator (community.st.com): *"We do not support 16x8... not currently
  supported by the tool chain"* (Sept 2025, X-CUBE-AI 10.2.0) and *"The support
  for 16bits is in the roadmap but is not planned for at least next year"*
  (2025-06-24). No 2026 post contradicts this.

**Documented gap (now moot):** `versions.json` lists **4.0.1** as latest but no
4.0.1-specific release note is published (served docs are 4.0.0-era; 4.0.1 looks
like a patch, stm32 platform 12.0.0→12.0.1). So 4.0.1 adding int16x8 could not be
*disproven* from docs alone — which is why the empirical check above was run. It
was worth running: the docs were right, but only measurement could establish it.

Accepted: float32 (Keras/.tflite/.onnx), full-integer **int8** TFLite
(per-channel ss/sa, representative dataset), ONNX QDQ int8, and mixed
int8-with-float-fallback.

## Artifacts (datasets/dmir/results/deploy/, ST-compatible)

Sizes are the actual `.tflite` bytes; accuracy is our own test-set evaluation.

| Model | params | fp32 KB | int8 KB | float | int8 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|---|---|
| REF_cnn_multi (their reference) | 441,347 | 1728.6 | 444.8 | 91.69% | 88.27% |
| cls_best (ours) | 83,803 | 337.8 | 110.3 | **92.08%** | 86.86% |
| cls_tiny (ours) | 7,953 | 37.0 | 17.4 | 91.30% | 85.46% |
| cls_noind (ablation) | 21,038 | 93.3 | 40.8 | 91.08% | 76.06% |
| lcr_best | 117,404 | 472.0 | 151.6 | MAE 0.2865 | MAE 0.4485 |
| lcl_best | 105,769 | 429.3 | 151.1 | MAE 0.3165 | MAE 0.3440 |

**The fair comparison is float32**: the published baseline deployed FP32 too. On
that footing our classifier is **5.1× smaller and more accurate** than their
reference CNN (337.8 KB @ 92.08% vs 1728.6 KB @ 91.69%), and the tiny model is
**46.7× smaller** at 91.30%.

int8 halves-to-thirds the flash again but costs real accuracy on these
wide-dynamic-range inputs (cls 92.1→86.9, cls_noind 91.1→76.1, LCR MAE
0.287→0.449). Honest framing: int8 is the *size/speed* operating point, float32
the *accuracy* one; int16x8 would give both but ST cannot deploy it (cite the
limitation).

## QAT recovers most of the int8 drop (cls_best, 2026-07-24)

`unas/qat_finetune.py`. Quantization-aware fine-tuning of `cls_best`, INT8:

| operating point | test acc | vs float32 |
|---|--:|--:|
| float32 | 92.08% | — |
| int8 **PTQ** | 86.86% | −5.22 |
| int8 **QAT** | **89.82%** | −2.27 |

QAT recovers **+2.96 points** over PTQ (57% of the gap closed) at the same int8
footprint (`cls_best_qat_int8.tflite` = 101,616 B; 22 int8 tensors, float32 I/O
— identical interface to the measured int8 PTQ). Fake-quant float acc 89.99% →
int8 89.82% (−0.17), so the INT8 conversion faithfully captured the QAT ranges.

**Honesty scope / how it was done.** tfmot's 8-bit scheme only registers 2D
layers, so the searched **1D** graph was re-expressed with width-1 kernels
(Conv1D→Conv2D(k,1), Pool1D→Pool2D(p,1); depthwise strides (s,1)→(s,s), a no-op
at width 1). The re-expression is **proven numerically exact**: float-2D test
acc = 0.9208 (= 1D original) and PTQ-2D = 0.8686 (= measured 1D int8), so the
PTQ-vs-QAT comparison is single-variable. Accuracy is deployment-real (measured
through the actual TFLite int8 interpreter). Fine-tune: Adam 2e-4, batch 256,
val-early-stop patience 8 restore-best, 22/40 epochs. Ran in the WSL `dmir_nas`
env (TF 2.21 / tf_keras / tfmot 0.8.1), which required a Keras-3→tf_keras port
of the saved model (`unas/qat_finetune.py`: rebuild from exported adjacency +
per-layer weight transfer).

**✔ MEASURED on-device** (STM32H7B3I-DK, Core 4.0.1-20581, balanced,
2026-07-24): **1.558 ms**, MACC 161,570, flash 131,008 B (128 KiB; weights
**83.28 KiB** — byte-identical to the PTQ int8 — + ~43 KiB library), RAM 8,404 B
(6.05 KiB act). The ST graph confirms a genuine int8 model (int8 filters/weights,
int32 bias throughout; float32 I/O with a Quantize/Dequantize wrapper).

Two things stand out vs the int8 PTQ point (1.885 ms, 104 KiB):
- **Faster: 1.558 vs 1.885 ms** (−17%). Both are int8 with identical weights; the
  difference is the op path: the width-1 **Conv2D** kernels ST emits appear
  better-optimized than the 1D convs of the PTQ model. Reported as an observation,
  not a proven mechanism: the QAT-vs-PTQ latency also carries the 1D→2D change, so
  the speed-up cannot be attributed to QAT alone (a PTQ-2D on-device run would
  isolate it — not done).
- **Bigger flash: 128 vs 104 KiB.** Weights are identical (83.28 KiB); the +24 KiB
  is ST **library** overhead (~43 vs ~21 KiB) — the 2D re-expression pulls in more
  kernel code (Conv2D + Reshape + extra conversions). This is the honest cost of
  the tfmot-2D workaround; a native-1D QAT (custom QuantizeConfigs) would keep the
  ~104 KiB footprint. Still 2.6× smaller than the float32 build (335 KiB).

Net: the QAT int8 point is **89.82% @ 1.558 ms @ 128 KiB** — the fastest of the
three operating points, at −2.3 accuracy vs float32 and +3.0 vs PTQ int8.

## MEASURED — ST Edge AI Developer Cloud (real board)

Core **4.0.1-20581**, platform STM32 MCU (tool 12.0.1), optimization
**balanced**, allocate inputs/outputs true. Board **STM32H7B3I-DK**
(Cortex-M7 @ 280 MHz, 1184 KB internal RAM, 2048 KB internal flash).

| Model | test acc | latency (ms) | MACC | flash (B) | RAM (B) |

| cls_best_float32 (ours, 84 k) | **92.08%** | **3.628** | 158,094 | 343,254 (335 KiB; weights 326.15 KiB + ~9 KiB lib) | 9,456 (8.42 KiB act + 832 B lib) |

| lcl_best_float32 (ours, 106 k; regression) | MAE 0.3165 | 28.77 | 1,658,927 | 423,494 (414 KiB; weights 403.61 KiB + ~10 KiB lib) | 28,264 (26.46 KiB act + ~1 KiB lib) |
| cls_best_**int8** (PTQ, 1D, 84 k) | 86.86% | **1.885** | 158,336 | 106,738 (104 KiB; weights 83.28 KiB + ~21 KiB lib) | 8,096 (6.05 KiB act + ~2 KiB lib) |

| cls_best_**int8 QAT, int8 I/O** (84 k) | **89.90%** | **1.435** | 158,710 | 131,562 (128 KiB; weights 83.28 KiB + ~43 KiB lib) | 6,204 (3.39 KiB act + ~3 KiB lib) |
| cls_best_**int16x8** (ours, 84 k) | — | 3.605 | 158,094 | 343,258 (335 KiB; weights 326.15 KiB + ~9 KiB lib) | 9,456 (8.42 KiB act + 832 B lib) |

The last row is **not a real int16x8 deployment** — ST dequantized it to float32
(see the section above). It is listed only as the evidence for that finding.

### Headline (same board, same Core version, same settings)

| vs reference | cls_best | cls_tiny |
|---|--:|--:|
| accuracy | **+0.4 pts** (92.08 vs 91.69) | −0.4 pts (91.30) |
| latency | **9.2× faster** (3.63 vs 33.52 ms) | **42.3× faster** (0.79 ms) |
| flash | **5.2× smaller** | **46.6× smaller** (37 KB) |
| RAM | 4.1× less | 4.2× less |
| MACC | 12.4× fewer | **61.9× fewer** |

Two operating points, both measured on real hardware: *more accurate and 9×
faster*, or *0.4 points lower and 42× faster in 37 KB with sub-millisecond
inference*.

### MEASURED — NUCLEO-F401RE (Cortex-M4 @ 84 MHz, 512 KB flash, 96 KB RAM)

`cls_tiny_float32`: **4.376 ms @ 84 MHz** (measured 2026-07-14, Core 4.0.1,
balanced). Flash/RAM are the platform-level optimize output and unchanged from
the H7B3 run: 37,954 B flash (**7.2%** of the F401's 512 KB), 9,412 B RAM
(9.8% of its 96 KB).

`cls_best_float32` measured on the F401 (2026-07-24): **18.35 ms @ 84 MHz**, flash
343,254 B (**65.5%** of 512 KB), RAM 9,456 B (9.6% of 96 KB). So the **accuracy
headline model itself** — 92.08%, the one that beats the reference CNN — runs on
the $10 Cortex-M4, on a board where that reference cannot run at all.

`cls_best_qat_int8` also measured on the F401 (2026-07-24): **7.381 ms @ 84 MHz**.
Flash/RAM unchanged from its H7B3 run (128 KiB flash = **25.0%** of 512 KB;
8,404 B RAM = 8.8% of 96 KB) — so the *full* classifier, quantized, runs on the
Cortex-M4 at **89.82%** accuracy. Cross-board it is 7.381 / 1.558 = 4.7× slower
than the M7 (≈ 3.3× clock × ~1.4× M4-vs-M7 IPC — consistent with the cls_tiny
scaling below).

**The headline here is categorical, not a ratio: the reference CNN cannot run on
this board at all.** Its 1,769,882 B of flash is **3.38× the F401's entire
512 KB**. No optimization setting fixes that. Every searched model is *smaller*
than the board's flash, but see the headroom caveat under the table:

| model | flash | % of F401 flash | benchmark on the board |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| REF_cnn_multi | 1,769,882 B | 337.6% | **no — 3.38× over, cannot run** |
| lcr_best fp32 | 474,522 B | 90.5% | **no result returned** (2026-07-24) |
| lcr_best **int8** | 150,504 B | 28.7% | yes (MAE 0.449 @ **28.10 ms**) |
| lcl_best | 423,494 B | 80.8% | yes (**MAE 0.317 @ 162.5 ms**) |
| cls_best | 343,254 B | 65.5% | yes (**92.08% @ 18.35 ms**) |
| cls_best int8 QAT | 131,008 B | 25.0% | yes (89.82% @ 7.381 ms) |
| cls_tiny | 37,954 B | **7.2%** | yes (91.30% @ 4.376 ms) |

**Flash headroom, not model size, is the real F401 limit — and the threshold is
now bracketed.** `lcr_best` (474,522 B, 90.5% of flash) returned **no measured
inference time** from the Developer Cloud (a dash, no reason given), while
`lcl_best` (423,494 B, 80.8%) — the discriminating test — **does run, at
162.5 ms**. Every model that returns a time has ≥100 KB of flash free; the only
one that does not has 49,766 B:

| model | flash used | % of flash | headroom | benchmark |
|---|--:|--:|--:|---|
| cls_tiny fp32 | 37,954 B | 7.2% | 486,334 B | ✔ 4.376 ms |
| cls_best int8 QAT | 131,008 B | 25.0% | 393,280 B | ✔ 7.381 ms |
| lcr_best **int8** | 150,504 B | 28.7% | 373,784 B | ✔ **28.10 ms** |
| cls_best fp32 | 343,254 B | 65.5% | 181,034 B | ✔ 18.35 ms |
| lcl_best fp32 | 423,494 B | 80.8% | 100,794 B | ✔ 162.5 ms |
| lcr_best **fp32** | 474,522 B | 90.5% | **49,766 B** | ✘ no result |

So the practical ceiling on this board lies **between 80.8% and 90.5% flash
occupancy** (between ~100 KB and ~50 KB of headroom): the validation application
and runtime need flash *on top of* the weights, and below roughly 50 KB there is
not enough left. Model-size arithmetic alone ("474 KB < 512 KB, therefore fits")
is not a deployability test.

### The controlled experiment that proves it is the footprint

`lcr_best` was then quantized and re-run on the same board. **Same architecture,
same task, same toolchain — only the numeric format differs:**

| build | flash | % of flash | headroom | F401 result |
|---|--:|--:|--:|---|
| lcr_best **fp32** | 474,522 B | 90.5% | 49,766 B | ✘ **no result** |
| lcr_best **int8** | 150,504 B | 28.7% | 373,784 B | ✔ **28.10 ms** |

The int8 build runs. Since the architecture, operator set and board are
identical, the failure cannot be attributed to an unsupported op or to the
model's structure — **what blocked the fp32 build was its flash footprint**, and
shrinking it 3.2× is sufficient to make the same network deployable. This
upgrades the headroom account from a plausible explanation to a demonstrated
one (ST still reports no reason for the dash, so the *precise* failure mode
inside the toolchain remains unreported, but the cause is now isolated).

**Consequence worth stating in the paper:** on this board quantization is not
merely a size/speed optimisation for `lcr_best`; it is the difference between a
model that cannot be benchmarked at all and one that runs in 28.10 ms.

Honest accuracy caveat: this int8 build is post-training-quantized, and on the
DMIR inputs that costs the regressor dearly (MAE 0.287 → **0.4485**). So the
deployable-on-F401 claim for `lcr_best` comes at a large accuracy price — and,
as the next section shows, QAT does **not** buy it back.

## QAT rescues the classifier but NOT the regressors (2026-07-27)

`unas/qat_finetune.py` was generalised to the regression heads and run on both.
The 2D re-expression is again exact — every anchor reproduces the 1D number to
four decimals (LCR float 0.2865, PTQ 0.4485; LCL float 0.3165, PTQ 0.3440) — so
these are clean single-variable PTQ-vs-QAT comparisons:

| model | metric | float32 | int8 PTQ | int8 QAT | QAT vs PTQ |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| cls_best | accuracy | 92.08% | 86.86% | **89.82%** | **+2.96 pts** ✔ |
| lcr_best | MAE (s) | 0.2865 | 0.4485 | 0.4313 | +0.0172 (marginal) |
| lcl_best | MAE (s) | 0.3165 | **0.3440** | 0.3620 | **−0.0180 (worse)** ✘ |

For LCL, plain PTQ int8 remains the better int8 build; QAT actively hurt it.
For LCR, QAT recovers only ~11% of the gap to float32 versus the classifier's
57%. **Robust to the fine-tuning rate:** repeating both at lr 2e-5 was worse
still (LCR +0.0115, LCL −0.0321), so this is not a single bad hyper-parameter —
tested 2e-4 and 2e-5, best of each reported above.

**Why the tasks differ (interpretation, consistent with the measurements).**
Classification only needs the *argmax* over three logits, which survives noisy
int8 activations; regression needs the actual continuous value, so the same
activation-resolution loss lands directly on the output. The relative damage
from int8 PTQ shows this plainly: the classifier loses 5.7% of its accuracy,
while LCR's error grows by **57%** and LCL's by 9%. Fine-tuning adapts *weights*,
but the information destroyed here is in the *activation representation* of
wide-dynamic-range inputs, which is why weight adaptation cannot recover it.

**Practical consequence.** The honest operating-point table is asymmetric:
- **Classification** — three usable points: float32 (92.08%), int8 QAT (89.82%,
  fastest at 1.558 ms), int8 PTQ (86.86%, smallest).
- **Regression** — float32 is the only accurate point. int8 (either PTQ or QAT)
  is available when it is the *only* way to fit the board (as on the F401, where
  it is what makes `lcr_best` run at all), but it costs roughly half the LCR
  accuracy and should be reported as a deployability fallback, not a result.

Artifacts: `datasets/dmir/results/qat/{lcr,lcl}_best_qat_int8.tflite` and their
`*_qat_result.json`. They were not benchmarked on-device; the accuracy makes them
uninteresting as operating points, and `lcr_best_int8` (PTQ) already supplies
the F401 latency figure.

So four of the five models run on this board, including a regression model at
162.5 ms — while the reference CNN cannot run at all, needing 3.38× the entire
flash. The classifiers are the strong case (91.3% at 4.4 ms; the full 92.08%
model at 18.35 ms) on a Cortex-M4 costing a fraction of the H7B3. This matches
the baseline paper's own report that their Transformer did not fit the F401.

**Cross-board scaling (same model, same file):**

| model | MACC | M7 @ 280 MHz | M4 @ 84 MHz | M4/M7 wall | implied IPC factor |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| cls_tiny fp32 | 31,742 | 0.7931 ms | 4.376 ms | 5.52× | 1.66× |
| cls_best fp32 | 158,094 | 3.628 ms | **18.35 ms** | 5.06× | 1.52× |
| cls_best int8 QAT | 161,570 | 1.558 ms | **7.381 ms** | 4.74× | 1.42× |
| lcl_best fp32 | 1,658,927 | 28.77 ms | **162.5 ms** | 5.65× | 1.69× |

Against a clock ratio of 3.33×, the M4 is consistently **1.4–1.7× slower per
clock** (the M7's dual-issue pipeline and cache), and the factor shrinks as the
kernels get more efficient. Cycles per MAC:

| model | MACC | M7 | M4 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| cls_tiny fp32 | 31,742 | 7.00 | 11.58 |
| cls_best fp32 | 158,094 | 6.43 | 9.75 |
| lcl_best fp32 | 1,658,927 | **4.86** | **8.23** |
| cls_best int8 QAT | 161,570 | **2.70** | **3.84** |

Three readings. (1) On the **float32** path, 4.9–11.6 cycles per MAC on cores
with single-cycle MAC instructions — arithmetic is not the bottleneck; per-op
overhead and memory traffic are. (2) **Efficiency improves with model size**:
cycles/MAC falls monotonically from cls_tiny (31 k MACs, 7.00) through cls_best
(158 k, 6.43) to lcl_best (1.66 M, 4.86), because a bigger model amortises the
fixed per-op overhead over more arithmetic — direct support for the
overhead-bound reading. (3) **int8 is ~2.4× more efficient per MAC** than float32
at comparable size (2.70 vs 6.43 on the M7), which is where the QAT model's speed
advantage comes from: it does *more* MACs (161,570 vs 158,094) in *less* time.

### The int8 operating point, measured (cls_best)

| cls_best | float32 | int8 | ratio |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| test accuracy | **92.08%** | 86.86% | **−5.2 pts** |
| latency | 3.628 ms | **1.885 ms** | 1.9× faster |
| flash | 343,254 B | **106,738 B** | 3.2× smaller |
| RAM | 9,456 B | 8,096 B | 1.2× (see below) |

int8 buys 1.9× speed and 3.2× flash for **5.2 accuracy points** — a poor trade on
this task's wide-dynamic-range inputs, which is why float32 remains our headline
configuration (and matches the baseline's own FP32 methodology). Note the flash
ratio is only 3.2×, not the naive 4×, because the int8 runtime library is larger
(~21 KiB vs ~9 KiB) — a fixed cost that matters at this model size. RAM barely
moves, for the interface reason explained below.

### RAM: input floor, then layer width, then branch liveness

Three regimes, each demonstrated by a different model.

**1. Input-bound (the classifiers).** cls_best (84 k params) and cls_tiny (8 k)
both land at ~9.2 KB RAM despite a 9× parameter gap. The 50×31 float32 input is
**6.2 KB** by itself and no architecture can go below it in FP32; activations add
only ~2–3 KB. The lever here is the input data type, not the model.

**Tested, and the prediction failed — instructively.** We predicted int8
quantization would cut the floor to 1.55 KB and drop RAM to ~3 KB. Measured:
cls_best_int8 activations are **6.05 KiB (6,195 B)** — barely below float32's
8.42 KiB, and suspiciously close to the 6,200 B float32 input buffer. That is the
explanation: **our converter emits a float32 I/O interface** (`inference_input_type`
left at default, verified in the flatbuffer — all three files take FLOAT32 in and
out), so ST must still allocate a 6,200 B float32 input buffer and quantize
internally. The int8 activations themselves are tiny; the arena is essentially
just that one float32 buffer. The `conversion_0` op doing the float32→int8 input
cast is visible in the per-layer time chart and is not cheap.

So the input-floor rule is **confirmed, not refuted** — the floor simply never
moved, because quantizing the *weights* does not quantize the *interface*.
**Actionable:** setting `inference_input_type=tf.int8` /
`inference_output_type=tf.int8` cuts the floor from 6,200 B to 1,550 B.

**✔ Artifact prepared and verified (2026-07-27):**
`unas/export_int8_io.py` → `datasets/dmir/results/deploy/cls_best_int8_io.tflite` (112,568 B),
int8 in / int8 out, input `scale=1.10578, zero_point=38`.

The re-export is **accuracy-neutral, proven**: evaluated through a quantizing
interpreter it scores **0.868624** — identical to the float32-I/O build to six
decimals, and matching the measured 0.8686. In the same run the float32-I/O
control rebuilt **byte-for-byte** identical to the committed
`cls_best_int8.tflite` (112,912 B), so the converter is deterministic and this
script reproduces `prepare_deploy.py` exactly.

*Note on the evaluator:* `eval_tflite` in `prepare_deploy.py` / `quantize_eval.py`
only **casts** (`.astype(dtype)`). That is a harmless no-op for a float32
interface, so every number measured so far is unaffected, but it would
silently destroy an int8 input. `export_int8_io.py` therefore carries its own
evaluator that quantizes in and dequantizes out.

*Why accuracy is unchanged:* the float32 interface never protected accuracy. The
float32-I/O build already quantizes the input internally with the same scale (the
visible `conversion_0` op); the int8 interface just moves that cast off the
device. The float32 interface was costing RAM and buying nothing.

**✔ MEASURED (2026-07-27) — direction confirmed, magnitude wrong.**

Same board (STM32H7B3I-DK), same settings, same weights — **only the tensor
interface differs**, so this is a clean single-variable comparison:

| | float32 I/O | int8 I/O | change |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| RAM total | 8,096 B | **5,444 B** | −2,652 B (**1.49×**) |
| — activations | 6.05 KiB (6,195 B) | **3.46 KiB (3,543 B)** | −2,652 B |
| latency | 1.885 ms | **1.752 ms** | −0.133 ms (**7.1% faster**) |
| flash | 106,738 B | 106,446 B | −292 B (weights identical, 83.28 KiB) |
| MACC | 158,336 | **155,230** | −3,106 (the cast ops) |
| cycles/MAC | 3.33 | 3.16 | — |
| test accuracy | 86.86% | 86.86% | unchanged |
| model type badge | `STAI_FORMAT_FLOAT` | **`STAI_FORMAT_S8`** | — |

**The interface change is not latency-neutral — it is 7.1% faster**, because the
per-inference float32→int8 cast on 1,550 elements is real work that the board no
longer does. So the float32 interface was costing both memory *and* time.

`conversion_0` **and** `conversion_14` are gone: the per-layer charts now begin
at `pool_1` and end at `gemm_26`, where the float32-I/O build began with
`conversion_0` and ended with `conversion_14`. That is the predicted effect, and
it also accounts for the MACC drop.

**Where our prediction failed.** We predicted ~3,446 B by *subtracting* the
buffer saving (6,200 − 1,550 = 4,650 B) from the measured 8,096 B. Measured is
5,444 B, so we were **2.0 KB optimistic**. The error is methodological: peak RAM
is a **max over simultaneously-live tensors plus kernel scratch, not a sum**,
the principle stated in the RAM-regimes section below and not applied to our own
forecast. Shrinking the input buffer from 6,200 B to 1,550 B did not subtract
4,650 B from the arena; it removed the input as *the binding constraint*, after
which the widest internal activation set the new floor at 3,543 B. Once the
input is no longer the binding constraint, shrinking it further buys nothing.

**What it settles.** int8 is now unambiguously the RAM-efficient point: 5,444 B
vs float32's 9,456 B (**1.74×**, up from a marginal 1.17×). The input-floor
account is confirmed on hardware, the floor was real, it moved when the
interface changed, and it stopped mattering once it fell below the internal peak.

**Revised int8 operating points on the H7B3I-DK** (all same board/settings):

| build | accuracy | latency | flash | RAM |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| int8 PTQ, float32 I/O | 86.86% | 1.885 ms | 104 KiB | 8,096 B |
| int8 PTQ, **int8 I/O** | 86.86% | **1.752 ms** | 104 KiB | **5,444 B** |
| int8 QAT, float32 I/O | **89.82%** | **1.558 ms** | 128 KiB | 8,404 B |

**✔ QAT + int8 I/O built (2026-07-28) — `datasets/dmir/results/qat/cls_best_qat_int8_io.tflite`**
(101,064 B, int8 in/out, input `scale=1.149315, zero_point=32`). Its tensor
inventory is **22 int8 + 9 int32 and zero float32** — fully integer end to end,
where the float32-I/O builds still carried two float32 tensors.

Accuracy **89.90%**, and the float32-I/O build produced from the *same* trained
model in the *same* run also scores 89.90%, so **the interface is accuracy-neutral
for QAT as well** (as it was for PTQ).

*Reproducibility note.* `qat_finetune.py` is now seeded (`SEED=42`) and saves the
trained fake-quant model (`cls_best_qat_model.h5`), so future interface variants
need no retraining. The seeded re-run scores **89.90%** where the original
unseeded run scored **89.82%** — a 0.08-point spread that is simply fine-tuning
stochasticity, and a useful reproducibility datapoint in its own right. The
committed `cls_best_qat_int8.tflite` is deliberately kept as the *original*
build, because the measured 1.558 ms / 8,404 B row above belongs to those exact
bytes; the int8-I/O artifact comes from the seeded run and is quoted at 89.90%.

**✔ MEASURED (2026-07-28, H7B3I-DK) — every prediction held, and it is the
fastest configuration we have.** 1.435 ms, MACC 158,710, flash 131,562 B
(128 KiB; weights 83.28 KiB + ~43 KiB lib), RAM 6,204 B (3.39 KiB act + ~3 KiB
lib), badge `STAI_FORMAT_S8`.

Against the float32-I/O QAT build: **latency 1.558 → 1.435 ms (7.9% faster)**,
**RAM 8,404 → 6,204 B (1.35×)**, flash unchanged (+554 B). At **2.53 cycles/MAC**
it is the most efficient kernel path measured (previous best 2.70).

The input and output casts are gone, as with PTQ. One internal `conversion_8`
remains — visible in the per-layer chart and as a `Quantize` node in the graph —
which is an *internal* requantisation between the pooling and the FC head, not
an I/O cast; the float32-I/O QAT build had that same op plus `conversion_0` and
`conversion_14` at the boundaries.

## Final classifier operating points (STM32H7B3I-DK, Core 4.0.1, balanced)

| build | accuracy | latency | flash | RAM |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| float32 | **92.08%** | 3.628 ms | 343,254 B | 9,456 B |
| int8 PTQ, float32 I/O | 86.86% | 1.885 ms | 106,738 B | 8,096 B |
| int8 PTQ, **int8 I/O** | 86.86% | 1.752 ms | **106,446 B** | **5,444 B** |
| int8 QAT, float32 I/O | 89.82% | 1.558 ms | 131,008 B | 8,404 B |
| int8 QAT, **int8 I/O** | 89.90% | **1.435 ms** | 131,562 B | 6,204 B |

Three of these are Pareto-optimal and none dominates the others:
- **float32** — the accuracy point (92.08%), and the like-for-like comparison
  with the published baseline, which also deployed FP32.
- **int8 QAT + int8 I/O** — the speed point: 89.90% at **2.53× the speed,
  2.61× less flash and 1.52× less RAM** than float32, for 2.18 accuracy points.
- **int8 PTQ + int8 I/O** — the size point: smallest flash (104 KiB) and RAM
  (5,444 B), at 86.86%.

The QAT rows carry ~22 KiB more library than the PTQ rows because of the width-1
2D re-expression, which is a cost of the tooling and not of quantisation; a
native-1D QAT would remove it (`paper/NOTES.md`).

**What the `STAI_FORMAT_*` badge actually means.** This run resolves an
earlier open puzzle. We once cited `STAI_FORMAT_FLOAT` as evidence that the
int16×8 model had been dequantized, then retracted it after the genuinely-int8
build showed the same badge. Now that a build with an int8 *interface* reports
`STAI_FORMAT_S8`, the rule is clear: **the badge reflects the I/O tensor dtype,
not the weight precision.** The retraction was correct, and the weights figure
remains the sound discriminator for the int16×8 finding.

**2. Width-bound (`lcr_best`, 20.8 KB).** Its wide 116-channel conv emits
25×116×4 B = 11.6 KB; peak ≈ input 6.2 + 11.6 ≈ 17.8 KB against 18.91 KiB
reported. Width moves RAM; depth and parameter count do not.

**3. Liveness-bound (`lcl_best`, 26.46 KiB).** Here the chain rule
`max(input, widest layer in+out)` **fails**, and the reason is not the one that
first suggests itself. The widest single activation is conv2d_1's 50×65×4 =
13,000 B, giving a chain bound of 6,200 + 13,000 = 19,200 B — well under the
measurement. But the obvious explanation ("the big branch tensors are all live
at once") is **false**: live-range analysis of the TFLite graph shows conv2d_1's
13,000 B output is live over ops [1,4] and conv2d_5's 12,000 B output over ops
[5,8] — **disjoint**. conv2d_4 frees the first before conv2d_5 allocates the
second. They are never co-resident.

The real peak is 24,800 B at op 8, and it is made of *small* tensors pinned for
a long time by the merge topology:

```
input        6,200 B  — live across all three branches (conv2d_1, conv2d_5, pool_10 all read it)
conv2d_5 out 12,000 B — the branch currently executing
conv2d_4 out  3,300 B — branch A's result, pinned until the Add at op 14
conv2d_8 out  3,300 B — branch B's result, pinned until the Add at op 15
             ------
             24,800 B
```

So a DAG does cost more RAM than a chain (+5.6 KB here), but through **long-lived
small tensors awaiting their merge**, not through wide tensors racing. The
remaining ~1–2 KB up to the reported 26.46 KiB is allocator behaviour
(offset-assignment fragmentation, alignment); it is **not derivable from the
graph** and is recorded here as unexplained rather than assigned a mechanism.
BatchNorm scratch is excluded — BN is folded into the convs.

Revised rule: **peak RAM = max over the schedule of all simultaneously-live
tensors.** For a chain that collapses to `max(input, widest in+out)`; for a DAG
it does not.

*Precision note:* do not quote "27,095 B". That is 26.46 × 1024 rounded back, and
27,095 is not even a multiple of 4 — impossible for a float32 arena. ST's
4-significant-digit display only constrains the true value to ≈27,090–27,100 B.

This is why our RAM advantage (~4×) is far smaller than our flash advantage
(5–47×).

### Our offline estimates are validated by these measurements

`unas/compute_footprint.py` predicted the reference CNN at flash 1728.6 KB,
peak RAM 38.4 KB, MACs 1,936,192 — versus ST's measured 1729.4 KB, 38.25 KiB,
1,965,360. Errors: **0.05% (flash), ~0.4% (RAM), 1.5% (MACC)**. Flash has since
reproduced to the byte on `lcl_best`: predicted 403.6 KiB vs measured 403.61 KiB
(**0.00%**), across five models.

**ST's MACC convention (resolves the residual ~1% MAC gap).** Our plain
`out_elems × taps` count is consistently ~1% low. That gap is *not* BatchNorm or
eltwise ops, as first assumed — **ST counts the bias accumulate as a MAC**.
Using `out_elems × (taps + 1)` on lcl_best gives 1,658,985 against ST's measured
1,658,927: **0.0035% (58 ops)**, versus −0.967% for the plain count. The
estimator is therefore near-exact once the convention is matched.

### Per-layer time does not track MACs on ST's float32 path

**The well-supported claim (safe to publish).** On ST's float32 kernels,
MAC count does not rank per-layer cost — not approximately, not even ordinally in
the tail. Evidence across three models and both boards:

- *cls_best (M7)*: `conv2d_5`, a depthwise conv carrying **1,209 MACs — 0.8% of
  the model — is the largest execution-time bar**. `conv2d_15`, with 41,503 MACs
  (26%), is a small bar. **34× fewer MACs, slowest layer.**
- *cls_tiny (M4)*: `pool_7` is an average-pool with **zero MACs** and is one of
  the largest bars; `gemm_13` has 24% of the model's MACs and is a small bar.
- *Both boards*: **7.0 cycles/MAC (M7) and 11.6 cycles/MAC (M4)** on cores with
  single-cycle MAC instructions, an order of magnitude of pure overhead.

The unifying explanation is that at these tensor sizes nothing is
arithmetic-bound; per-op overhead and memory traffic dominate, so zero-MAC ops
(pooling) and low-intensity ops (depthwise) cost real time while a dense GEMM
with most of the MACs is cheap.

**Scope: float32 only.** The int8 build of cls_best inverts the picture —
`gemm_25` (43.4% of MACs) becomes the largest bar and time tracks MACs well. The
anomaly belongs to ST's float32 kernels, not to the board or the architecture;
plausibly the int8 path uses the optimised CMSIS-NN kernels and the float32 path
does not.

### ⚠ Downgraded: the "unfused ReLU" explanation is NOT established

An earlier draft here claimed the correlate was **absence of a fused ReLU**, at
4/4 across lcl_best (3/3, p ≈ 0.6%) and cls_best (1/1), with shape-matched
controls. **`cls_tiny` weakens this and it is recorded as a hypothesis only.**

cls_tiny has **zero** unfused convs (both its convs carry a fused ReLU; only the
final 219-MAC output FC is linear) — yet it shows the same strong MAC/time
inversions anyway (`pool_7`: 0 MACs, large bar; `gemm_13`: 24% of MACs, small
bar). **So an unfused ReLU is not necessary for the inversion to appear**, which
is what the earlier framing implied.

What survives, stated carefully:
- The observation that lcl_best's three no-ReLU convs are exactly its three top
  bars is real, and the shape-matched controls are real (lcl_best `conv2d_1` vs
  `conv2d_5`: same input tensor, both 1×1, conv2d_1 has 8.3% **more** MACs yet is
  a sliver).
- But cls_tiny shows the effect does not require unfused convs, and it ran on a
  **different board**, so it is not a clean refutation either. Two models on one
  board is thin support for a mechanism.
- Honest position: **the fusion correlation is one candidate explanation among
  several (op overhead, memory traffic, kernel selection), not an established
  one.** Do not put a mechanism in the paper without the ablation.

**Open items before any of this is publishable:**
1. Confirm whether the per-layer chart is board-measured or ST cost-model
   estimated. If estimated, the whole per-layer analysis weakens to a statement
   about ST's cost model.
2. Run the ablation: re-export one no-ReLU conv with a ReLU appended, shapes held
   constant; see whether its bar collapses. Cheap and decisive.

The paper currently states only the well-supported claim (MACs do not predict per-layer
time on the float32 path), not the mechanism.

### Where the reference CNN spends its budget (per-layer, from the DC charts)

- **Flash** is dominated by a single layer: `gemm_14` = 1,638,656 B of the
  1,762,316 B of weights — **93.0%**, the `Flatten(6400) → Dense(64)` head
  (64×6400 = 409.6 k of its 441 k parameters). It flattens the whole 50×128
  feature map instead of pooling it.
- **Latency**, by contrast, is dominated by the `eltwise` (BatchNorm mul/add
  over 50×128 tensors) and the convs; `gemm_14` costs almost no time despite
  being 93% of the flash. Flash-bound and time-bound layers are decoupled.
- **Ours (cls_best) is also dense-dominated in flash** (`gemm_24` = 82.5% of
  weights) — so the honest statement is *not* "we avoid a large FC" but: the
  searched model **pools before the head** (`pool_18`), which shrinks the FC
  input and makes its dense layer **~5.9× smaller** than the reference's
  (280 KB vs 1.64 MB).

**FC dominance falls as the search space is exploited** (share of weights held by
the largest FC, all computed from the deployed `.tflite` files):

| model | biggest-FC share | largest layer overall |
|---|--:|---|
| REF_cnn_multi | **93.0%** | that FC |
| cls_tiny | 90.9% | that FC |
| cls_noind | 90.3% | that FC |
| cls_best | 82.5% | that FC |
| lcr_best | 39.6% | that FC |
| lcl_best | **11.4%** | `conv2d_30`, a **conv** (24.3%) |

lcl_best is the only model whose flash is not FC-dominated at all. (Earlier drafts
quoted "82–95%" for the classifiers and "~95%" for the reference; both were
inflated, the true figures are 82.5–90.9% and 93.0%.)

## Benchmark plan (ST Edge AI Developer Cloud)

Both target boards are in the farm: **STM32H7B3I-DK** and **NUCLEO-F401RE**.
Keep settings constant across all runs or the comparison is meaningless:
**pin one ST Edge AI Core version** (e.g. 4.0.1), optimization **balanced**,
compression **none**. Archive each `report.json`.

Priority 1 — main deployment table, board **STM32H7B3I-DK**, float32:
1. `REF_cnn_multi_float32.tflite` ← the baseline anchor
2. `cls_best_float32.tflite`
3. `cls_tiny_float32.tflite`
4. `lcr_best_float32.tflite`
5. `lcl_best_float32.tflite`

Priority 2, the low-end story, board **NUCLEO-F401RE**, float32:
6. `cls_tiny_float32.tflite` (the baseline's Transformer did not fit the F401)

Priority 3 — quantify the int8 operating point, **STM32H7B3I-DK**:
7. `cls_best_int8.tflite`

Record per run: **inference time (ms)**, **flash / rom_size**, **RAM /
ram_size + activations_size**, **MACC**, board, Core version.

Scriptable alternative (avoids UI clicking): the `stm32ai_dc` Python client
(`stm32ai-modelzoo-services/common/stm32ai_dc`) — `Stm32Ai(CloudBackend(user,
pwd, version))`, `get_benchmark_boards()`, `upload_model()`, `benchmark(
CliParameters(model=...), 'STM32H7B3I-DK')`. Also local: X-CUBE-AI "Validate on
target" in CubeMX with the board you own (highest fidelity, no queue).

## Reference Transformers on the boards (2026-09-08)

The internal reference regressors are Transformers and had never been deployed,
so "is a Transformer viable on this MCU?" had only ever been answered by
argument. `unas/transformer_deploy.py` rebuilds each one from the configuration
stored inside its `.keras` file (three custom layer classes exist in no public
repository, so the file cannot be loaded directly) and loads the original
weights.

**Scope of this measurement.** The rebuild is architecturally exact — parameter
counts match the originals to the unit, 333,505 and 49,089 — but it does not
reproduce the reported test RMSE (0.42 / 0.44), so the weight mapping is
unverified and **no accuracy claim is made from these artifacts**. Latency,
flash and RAM are functions of the operator graph and tensor shapes rather than
of weight values, so those are reported. The JSON records carry `usable_for`
and `not_usable_for` fields stating this.

| model (float32) | params | MACC | H7B3I-DK | F401RE | flash | RAM |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Transformer LCR (reference) | 333,505 | 95,209,897 | 368.82 ms | does not fit | 1,368,946 B | 143,300 B |
| lcr_best (searched) | 117,404 | 860,407 | 14.06 ms | 28.10 ms (int8) | 474,522 B | 20,772 B |
| Transformer LCL (reference) | 49,089 | 33,949,021 | 45.64 ms | 248.37 ms | 221,150 B | 66,916 B |
| lcl_best (searched) | 105,769 | 1,658,927 | 28.77 ms | 162.5 ms | 423,494 B | 28,264 B |

The LCL row is the informative one: that Transformer carries **fewer than half**
the parameters of our LCL model yet needs 20× the MACs and 1.59× the time.
Attention recomputes across the sequence, so parameter count understates
Transformer cost badly, and comparisons drawn on parameter counts alone measure
the wrong quantity. For LCR the gap is 111× the MACs and 26.2× the latency.

The LCR Transformer fails on the F401 for two independent reasons: 1,368,946 B
of flash against 524,288 B available, and 143,300 B of RAM against 98,304 B.

Conversion note: both convert with TFLite **builtin operators only** — no
TF-select fallback — using BATCH_MATMUL, SOFTMAX, MEAN, RSQRT,
SQUARED_DIFFERENCE, TRANSPOSE, STRIDED_SLICE and FULLY_CONNECTED. So a
Transformer of this size *is* compilable for an MCU; the objection is cost, not
feasibility, and claiming infeasibility would be wrong.

## Hand-designed DSCNN on the boards (2026-09-23)

The DSCNN is a PyTorch model. `scripts/run_baseline.py <task> --save` trained one run
per task and kept the weights (`datasets/dmir/results/hand/`);
`scripts/export_hand_cnn.py` exports them and `unas/deploy_hand_cnn.py` rebuilds the
network in Keras layer by layer (explicit zero padding, so the strided convolutions
see the same samples as PyTorch), checks the outputs against PyTorch (largest
difference 3.7e-6) and converts it exactly like the searched models: float32, full
int8 PTQ with float I/O and with int8 I/O, 500 calibration windows. Every file is
scored on the full test set; `unas/st_benchmark.py` measured them through the ST API
(Core 4.0.1, balanced; records in `results/deploy/benchmarks_api.jsonl`).

| model | build | test | H7B3I-DK | F401RE | flash | RAM | MACC |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| intention, 10,451 params | float32 | 90.96% | 3.272 ms | 18.70 ms | 51,382 B | 11,632 B | 171,971 |
| | int8 PTQ | 87.14% | 1.261 ms | 6.043 ms | 30,319 B | 11,396 B | 173,205 |
| | int8 PTQ, int8 I/O | 87.14% | 1.132 ms | 5.607 ms | 30,047 B | 9,388 B | 170,099 |
| LCR, 10,321 params | float32 | RMSE 0.439 s | 3.265 ms | 18.83 ms | 50,862 B | 11,632 B | 171,841 |
| | int8 PTQ | RMSE 0.652 s | 1.258 ms | 6.042 ms | 31,139 B | 10,976 B | 173,071 |
| | int8 PTQ, int8 I/O | RMSE 0.652 s | 1.128 ms | 5.611 ms | 30,871 B | 8,968 B | 169,969 |
| LCL, 10,321 params | float32 | RMSE 0.459 s | 3.265 ms | 18.83 ms | 50,862 B | 11,632 B | 171,841 |

What this settles:

- **Intention:** the searched 8 k model (cls_tiny, 91.19 ± 0.32% over five seeds)
  and the DSCNN (91.50 ± 0.47%) are equally accurate, and cls_tiny runs 4.1 times
  faster (0.793 against 3.272 ms) with 5.4 times fewer MACs. The DSCNN's strided
  first convolution over all 31 channels holds 124,000 of its MACs. This is the one
  place where the search wins on cost against the hand-designed network.
- **Time to lane change:** the DSCNN is more accurate over five seeds (0.454 / 0.469 s
  against 0.483 / 0.496 s) and faster (3.265 ms against 14.06 and 28.77 ms).
- **int8:** PTQ costs the DSCNN 3.8 points on intention and raises the LCR RMSE from
  0.439 to 0.652 s, the same wide-range-input problem as the searched models; QAT was
  not run for the DSCNN.
